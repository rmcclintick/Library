# Library
My Library is a reading list application based on the assignment here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library

The application can be reached at: https://rmcclintick.github.io/Library/

# What I learned:
* use of javascript objects
* manipulation of the attributes of DOM elements through javascript
* use of javascript object prototype functions
* use of the css display attribute to hide/show popup forms within the same window
* use of localStorage and JSON.stringify/parse for storing object data
